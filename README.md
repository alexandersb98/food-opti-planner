# Meal Plan Optimizer

An optimization-based meal planning tool: give it a set of ingredients and a
set of constraints (nutrient targets, budget, etc.), and it lays out a
multi-day eating plan that satisfies them as well as possible. When
constraints conflict, it finds a good-enough compromise instead of
failing outright.

**Status:** First slice implemented as the `meal_planner` library:
recipes, tags, day and horizon constraints (hard and soft), serving
multipliers, and STRICT solving with violation and conflict reports.
No CLI or UI yet.

Run the tests with `python3 -m pip install 'ortools>=9.12,<10' 'pytest>=8'`
and then `python3 -m pytest`. The reference-scale benchmark is opt-in:
`python3 -m pytest -m benchmark -s`.

## `lp_solver/` — small standalone sample app

A separate, self-contained toy: reads a linear programming problem from
a structured text file and prints its optimal solution. Pure Python, no
dependencies. See [`lp_solver/README.md`](lp_solver/README.md) for the
file format and usage; example problems live in [`examples/`](examples).
